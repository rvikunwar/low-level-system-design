# Low-Level Design Patterns

This repository contains a collection of low-level design patterns, along with examples and explanations. Each design pattern addresses a specific software design problem and provides a reusable solution that promotes code reusability, flexibility, and maintainability.

## Design Patterns

The following low-level design patterns are covered in this repository:

1. **Strategy Pattern**: The Strategy Pattern allows for defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable. It enables the client to choose a strategy dynamically at runtime, without tightly coupling the code to a specific implementation.

2. **Observer Pattern**: The Observer Pattern establishes a one-to-many relationship between a subject (publisher) and multiple observers. The subject notifies the observers automatically whenever its state changes, promoting loose coupling between them.

3. **Decorator Pattern**
