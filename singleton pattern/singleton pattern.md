# Singleton pattern 

A class with only one instance
Provides a global access of that instance
Whenever you would ask for a instance, it will give you same instance each and every time
Use only, when we need one instance of it currently or in future
Issue- global scope is dangerous, any piece of code can manipulate that instance
